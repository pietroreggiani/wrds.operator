The goal of wrds.operator is to …

## Installation

You can install the released version of wrds.operator from
[CRAN](https://CRAN.R-project.org) with:

``` r
install.packages("wrds.operator")
```

## Example

What is special about using `README.Rmd` instead of just `README.md`?
You can include R chunks like so:

You’ll still need to render `README.Rmd` regularly, to keep `README.md`
up-to-date. `devtools::build_readme()` is handy for this. You could also
use GitHub Actions to re-render `README.Rmd` every time you push. An
example workflow can be found here:
<https://github.com/r-lib/actions/tree/master/examples>.

You can also embed plots, for example:

<img src="man/figures/README-pressure-1.png" width="100%" />

In that case, don’t forget to commit and push the resulting figure
files, so they display on GitHub and CRAN.

# TODO list

-   Edit the roxygens so that they import the right packages.
-   Edit the readme file include reference to the WRDS guide.
