This is a client to query data from the WRDS database. The database can
be accessed using SQL queries.

The functions here allow you to inspect the data structure of the data
on WRDS, and query the tables you are interested in.

Before being able to use it, you will need to set up a `.pgpass` file as
explained on the \[WRDS
website\](<https://wrds-www.wharton.upenn.edu/pages/support/programming-wrds/programming-r/r-from-your-computer/>.

## Installation

You can install the development version of the package from Pietroâ€™s
Github.

``` r
devtools::install_githubpackages("pietroreggiani/wrds.operator")
```
